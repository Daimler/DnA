Update the image names of the respective services in the values.yaml.

  * Refer [values.yaml](../kubernetes/helm/values.yaml)

Eg: To update the image name of frontend-service , refer the below screenshot .Just like the below update the image names for every service in the [values.yaml](../kubernetes/helm/values.yaml).

![This is an image](./images/frontend_image_update.PNG)

For pulling the images from the registry, update the .dockerconfigjson value in the [values.yaml](../kubernetes/helm/values.yaml).

For more info on kubernetes secret for pulling the images.

  * Refer [harbor-pull-secret manifest file](../deployment/kubernetes/helm/charts/backend/templates/secrets/harbor-pull-secret.yaml)


#### **Helm**

We are offering mutiple services via this helm chart , Have a look into those by clicking the link [Readme.md](../README.md).

In order to use our helm charts you should have kafka service . you can install by referring the [Kafka Service](https://github.com/apache/kafka).

After installing the kafka, update the `naasBroker` parameter value in [Values.yaml](../deployment/kubernetes/helm/values.yaml) to the Fully qualified domain name of the kafka service.

Execute the below commands to deploy application on the kubernetes cluster using helm.
```
cd <<Clonned Folder Path>>\deployment\kubernetes\helm
helm install dna . -f ./charts/values.yaml
```
Execute the below command to list out the helm releases.
```
helm list
```
**Vault service**

We are providing vault service to store the API keys that were generated in the malware scan service.

After installating the application with helm , vault service will throw an error that `Readiness probe error in vault â€“ Seal Type shamir Initialized true Sealed`.

To resolve this , intialize the vault service and unseal the root key .
```
kubectl exec vault-0 -n vault  -- vault operator init
```
After executing the above command , it will give us the root token and 5 keys . Save the root token and mention it in storagebe and backend sections of the [values.yaml](../deployment/kubernetes/helm/values.yaml).

We can unseal the vault service with any of the `3 keys out of 5`.
```
kubectl exec vault-0 -n vault  -- vault operator unseal <key_01>
kubectl exec vault-0 -n vault  -- vault operator unseal <key_02>
kubectl exec vault-0 -n vault  -- vault operator unseal <key_03>
```
For reference 

![This is an image](./images/vault-unsealed.PNG)

Execute the below commands to enable the kv engine for storing the secrets:
```
kubectl exec vault-0 -n vault  -- vault operator login <<Vault_root_token>>
kubectl exec vault-0 -n vault  -- vault secrets enable -version=2 -path=kv kv
```
**Attachment scan**

To scan the attachments free from malicious code  you can use the malware scan service . We are creating malware scan as a service by abstracting the [clamav service](https://github.com/Cisco-Talos/clamav).

To use this service, set the respective values to the below parameters in the [values.yaml](../deployment/kubernetes/helm/values.yaml).

Open the website http://localhost:7179 in your browser and go to `myservices->malwarescan -> Genrate the apikey` and copy the application key and application id.
```
avscanApiKey:   
avscanAppId: 
```

**Airflow**

We are also providing Apache Airflow as a service in the DnA platform to programmatically author , schedule and monitor workflows.

Go to the deployment directory and execute the below commands to build the images
```
docker-compose -f ./docker-compose-airflow.yml     (#Building airflow-backend service)
docker build ./dockerfiles/airflow -t <image_name_of_your_wish> -f ./dockerfiles/airflow.Dockerfile   (#building Airflow service)
docker build ./dockerfiles/airflow -t <image_name_of_your_wish> -f ./dockerfiles/git-sync.Dockerfile (#Building Git-sync image)
```
After building the images , update the images names in the [values.yaml](../deployment/kubernetes/helm/values.yaml) . You can refer the values.yaml to check on where to update the image names.

We are storing the DAGS of the airflow in the git repo . For this you need to create a new git repo and update the below values in the [Values.yaml](../deployment/kubernetes/helm/values.yaml).
```
gitToken:
gitUrl:
gitMountPath:
gitBranch:
gitUserName:
gitPassword:
repo: 
```
If you are accessing the git over ssh you can update those values in the below parametrs in the [Values.yaml](../deployment/kubernetes/helm/values.yaml)
```
knownHosts:
gitSshKey:
```

The below secret key is used to run the flask app. Refer the offical airflow docs for generating the secret key (https://airflow.apache.org/docs/apache-airflow/1.10.11/configurations-ref.html) 
```
webserver:
  secretkey:
```

You can enable openID connect on our DNA platform . In order to work this you need to set the all the OIDC releated paramerts in the [values.yaml](../deployment/kubernetes/helm/values.yaml)
```
oidcClientID:
oidcClientSecret:
oidcInfoUrl:
oidcIntrospectionUrl:
oidcRevocationUrl:
oidcDisabled: true
oidc.logout.uri:
```

Refer the airflow section in the [values.yaml](../deployment/kubernetes/helm/values.yaml) for more info on each parameter.


**Notebooks**

We are also offering jupyter notebooks as a service in our DnA platform , which allows you to create and share documents that contain live code, mathematical equations, graphics, maps, plots, visualizations, and narrative text. It integrates with many programming languages like Python, PHP, R, C#, etc.

Build the images of the notebook service using the below command
```
cd documents
docker-compose -f docker-compose-notebook.yml build
```
update the images names in the [values.yaml](../deployment/kubernetes/helm/values.yaml) . You can refer the values.yaml to check on where to update the image names.

Update the configproxyauthtoken value in the [values.yaml](../deployment/kubernetes/helm/values.yaml) and this can be generated by using the "openssl rand -hex 32"
```
app:
  jupyter:
    config:
      configproxy_auth_token: ""
```


**Upgrading**

Do Helm Upgrade, if you made changes on helm files.
```
helm upgrade dna . -f ./charts/values.yaml
```

**Accessing the application with localhost**

Port-forward the dna-frontend and storage-mfe service to any port_of_your_wish.

```
kubectl port-forward service/storage-mfe 7175:80
kubectl port-forward service/dna-frontend-service 7179:3000
```
After executing the above step , you can access the application by opening the (http://localhost:7179) in your browser.

**Production Environemnt**

We are already providing ingress manifest files for every microservice. So install any kubernetes ingress controller to install the application directly in the production environment.

By default, we are disabling the ingress in [values.yaml](../deployment/kubernetes/helm/values.yaml)* . If you are using in the production env then set the parameter `enabled: true` in the ingress section.

Eg : Please refer the below image and enable the ingress for every microservice.

![enabling the ingress for frontend service](./images/ingress_enabled_true.PNG)

**Note**

* *If you are not using 7175 and 7179 ports then change the below parameter values in [values.yaml](../deployment/kubernetes/helm/values.yaml)*. 
```
storageMFEAppURL:
PROJECTSMO_CONTAINER_APP_URL:
```

**Uninstalling**

To uninstall the helm app

```
helm uninstall dna
```
