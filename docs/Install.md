## **Install with docker-compose**

Docker Compose will help to start the application locally on your computer and provides support to develop and debug the docker containers in the local machine.

Software Prerequisites:

* Git 2.35.1+
* Docker 20.10.13+
* Docker Compose v2.3.3+

Hardware Prerequisites :

* Recommend 6GB free RAM
  
#### **Note**
  
  * *For windows user, enable WSL engine in Docker Desktop. Check [FAQ](./FAQ.md) to enable WSL*.
  * *Make sure your firewall is not restricting the npm and gradle packages of the docker files*.

#### **Git Cloning** 

As a first step you need to clone the Git Repo in your local computer. (this can be done by executing the below command on terminal/command prompt/some visual git client(GithubDesktop)).
```
git clone https://github.com/mercedes-benz/DnA.git
```
Once when cloning is finishied , you will have a copy of the entire repository locally.Go to the deployment folder by executing the the below command. (replace <`<Cloned Folder>`> with actual location path of your computer).
```
cd <<Clonned Folder Path>>/deployment/
```
#### **Docker Compose**
Execute the below docker-compose command to create the DnA application.
```
docker-compose -f docker-compose-local-basic.yml up -d
```
For Reference:

![This is an image](./images/Docker-compose-sucess.png)

Open the website (http://localhost:8080) in your browser. If you have made any changes in the source files add `--build --force-recreate` args to docker-compose command. If you face any issue with docker-compose,refer [FAQ](./FAQ.md).

To stop the application.
```
docker-compose -f docker-compose-local-basic.yml down
```

## **Install with Helm**

Helm helps you to deploy and manage Kubernetes applications in an easier way.

Prerequisites :

* Kubernetes Cluster 1.22+
* Helm v3.8.1+
* kubectl 1.22+
* Kafka [Refer here](https://github.com/apache/kafka)
* Docker Image Regitsry

#### **Git Cloning** 

As a first step you need to clone the Git Repo in your local computer (this can be done by executing the below command on terminal/command prompt/some_visual_git_client(GithubDesktop)).

```
git clone https://github.com/mercedes-benz/DnA.git
```
Once when cloning is finishied, you will have a copy of the entire repository locally .Go to the deployment folder by executing the the below command.  (replace <`<Cloned Folder>`> with actual location path of your computer).
```
cd <<Clonned Folder Path>>/deployment/
```
#### **Build & push images**

Execute the below command to create images of dnA-frontend,dna-Backend, bitnami-postgress ,dashboard , malware , vault, clamav, naas-backend , zooKeeper , broker , storage-mfe , storage-be and minio .

Refer [docker-compose-local-basic.yml](../deployment/docker-compose-local-basic.yml)
```
cd <<Clonned Folder Path>>/deployment/
docker-compose -f docker-compose-local-basic.yml build
```
Execute the below commands for pushing the images to your reposirtory . Replace the contents that are enclosed in <<...>> to the respective values.
```
docker tag <<image_name_that_were_built_with_docker_compose>> <<your_repository_name/image_name_of_your_wish>>
docker push <<your_repository_name/image_name_of_your_wish>>
```
#### **Namespaces**

Execute the below commands to create namespaces.
```
kubectl create ns dna
kubectl create ns clamav
kubectl create ns naas
kubectl create ns dashboard
kubectl create ns vault
kubectl create ns storage
```
#### **values.yaml**

Update the image names of the respective services in the values.yaml.

  * Refer [values.yaml](../kubernetes/helm/values.yaml)

Eg: To update the image name of frontend-service , refer the below screenshot .Just like the below update the image names for every service in the [values.yaml](../kubernetes/helm/values.yaml).

![This is an image](./images/frontend_image_update.PNG)

For pulling the images from the registry, update the .dockerconfigjson value in the [values.yaml](../kubernetes/helm/values.yaml).

For more info on kubernetes secret for pulling the images.

  * Refer [harbor-pull-secret manifest file](../deployment/kubernetes/helm/charts/backend/templates/secrets/harbor-pull-secret.yaml)


#### **Helm**

We are offering mutiple services via this helm chart , Have a look into those by clicking the link [Readme.md](../README.md).

In order to use our helm charts you should have kafka service . you can install by referring the [Kafka Service](https://github.com/apache/kafka).

After installing the kafka, update the `naasBroker` parameter value in [Values.yaml](../deployment/kubernetes/helm/values.yaml) to the Fully qualified domain name of the kafka service.

Execute the below commands to deploy application on the kubernetes cluster using helm.
```
cd <<Clonned Folder Path>>\deployment\kubernetes\helm
helm install dna . -f ./charts/values.yaml
```
Execute the below command to list out the helm releases.
```
helm list
```
**Vault service**

We are providing vault service to store the API keys that were generated in the malware scan service.

After installating the application with helm , vault service will throw an error that `Readiness probe error in vault â€“ Seal Type shamir Initialized true Sealed`.

To resolve this , intialize the vault service and unseal the root key .
```
kubectl exec vault-0 -n vault  -- vault operator init
```
After executing the above command , it will give us the root token and 5 keys . Save the root token and mention it in storagebe and backend sections of the [values.yaml](../deployment/kubernetes/helm/values.yaml).

We can unseal the vault service with any of the `3 keys out of 5`.
```
kubectl exec vault-0 -n vault  -- vault operator unseal <key_01>
kubectl exec vault-0 -n vault  -- vault operator unseal <key_02>
kubectl exec vault-0 -n vault  -- vault operator unseal <key_03>
```
For reference 

![This is an image](./images/vault-unsealed.PNG)

Execute the below commands to enable the kv engine for storing the secrets:
```
kubectl exec vault-0 -n vault  -- vault operator login <<Vault_root_token>>
kubectl exec vault-0 -n vault  -- vault secrets enable -version=2 -path=kv kv
```
**Attachment scan**

To scan the attachments free from malicious code  you can use the malware scan service . We are creating malware scan as a service by abstracting the [clamav service](https://github.com/Cisco-Talos/clamav).

To use this service, set the respective values to the below parameters in the [values.yaml](../deployment/kubernetes/helm/values.yaml).

Open the website http://localhost:7179 in your browser and go to `myservices->malwarescan -> Genrate the apikey` and copy the application key and application id.
```
avscanApiKey:   
avscanAppId: 
```
For reference:

**Upgrading**

Do Helm Upgrade, if you made changes on helm files.
```
helm upgrade dna . -f ./charts/values.yaml
```

**Accessing the application**

Port-forward the dna-frontend and storage-mfe service to any port_of_your_wish.

```
kubectl port-forward service/storage-mfe 7175:80
kubectl port-forward service/dna-frontend-service 7179:3000
```
After executing the above step , you can access the application by opening the (http://localhost:7179) in your browser.


**Note**

* *If you are not using 7175 and 7179 ports then change the below parameter values in [values.yaml](../deployment/kubernetes/helm/values.yaml)*. 
```
storageMFEAppURL:
PROJECTSMO_CONTAINER_APP_URL:
```

**Uninstalling**

To uninstall the helm app

```
helm uninstall dna
```
