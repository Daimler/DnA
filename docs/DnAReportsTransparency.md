Many people in the company have often a need to present their data in the visual way to somebody in form of report, but quite often it can happen that people from different areas of your organization are creating very similar reports, to same or similar consumers and those reports often contain same KPI's - which gives lot of potential for improvement.

DnA Platform provides possibility for organization to create Report Transparency accross entire organization, enabling you to optimize and focus on the right reports.

Report Transparency feature enables you to capture report metadata which can be further used for analysis, tracking, and planning.
Those Reports metadata includes:

1. Report basic description (what do you want to achieve, for whom and why)
2. Customer for the report (who is using it and for which purpose) and who is providing it
3. KPI (which KPI'S are being presented on the report)
4. Data & functions (which data sources are you using to realize this)
5. Members (who are developers of those report and who can administer this entry)
