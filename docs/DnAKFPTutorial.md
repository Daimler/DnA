# How to convert a Jupyter Notebook into a Kubeflow Pipeline

*The DnA platform offers a holistic open-source [MLOps pipeline](https://github.com/mercedes-benz/DnA/blob/kubeflow-tutorial-pipelines/docs/DnAMLOPsArchitecture.md) utilizing existing FOSS solutions. This tutorial demonstrates the three simple steps required for the conversion of a Jupyter Notebook into a [Kubeflow Pipeline](https://github.com/kubeflow/pipelines) using [Kale](https://github.com/kubeflow-kale/kale) directly from the DnA Platform environment.*

**Step 1**:

Users can launch their own Jupyter Notebooks instance by clicking on the "My Workspaces" tab.

**Step 2**:

To convert a Jupyter Notebook into a Kubeflow Pipeline, users should enable the Kale JupyterLab extension. Then all they have to do is, annotate the different cells of the Notebook, define their interdependencies, specify an experiment and a pipeline name, and finally click on the "COMPILE AND RUN" button.
