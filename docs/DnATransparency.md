In all parts of the company you have some innitiatives working with data, learning from data and developing services based on this data which is in nature very good, but...
Soon you will start to notice that two parts of the company are doing very similar, if not the same, initiative but they are not aware about each other and because of this company is focusing on too many things in a not so efficient way (eg. double spending of resources and budget).
DnA Platform provides this kind of transparency accross organization, connecting people and sharing ideas.

Transparency feature enables you to capture project metadata which can be further used for analysis and project tracking, those project metadata includes:

1. Project description (what do you want to achieve, for whom and why)
2. Team member information (who is working in which role in this initiative)
3. Milestone (at which stage are you currently in the realization of this solution)
4. Datasources (which data sources are you using to realize this)
5. Analytics (where and with which tools/platforms are you realizing it)
6. Sharing (how can you share and collaborate with rest of organization)
7. Digital Value (what is really digital value that you are planning to generate with this solution)
