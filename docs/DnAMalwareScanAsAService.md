Malware Scan as a Service is primarily created for the need of the DnA Platform case as on several places we are enabling uploading of attachments and we need to be sure that nobody will upload malicious document. <br>
For purpose of scanning we have utilized ClamAV engine which is being refreshed on a daily basis with new signatures. <br>
Around this ClamAV engine we have built wrapper and exposed it over API so that when some kind of file is provided over API (POST request to /api/v1/scan/upload), our API temporary stores file in the container, invokes ClamAV SDK to scan it and provides you response with information if file contains malicious code or not. <br>

Beside POST request there is only a Helth check status GET API request over which you can query health status of MSaaS. <br>

List of available APIâ€™s is available on:
https://*yourwebsite*/avscan/swagger-ui.html#/scans <br>

From user perspective you can simply open Malware scan service and generate a new ApplicationID and APIKey which you have then to use when making any of the above mentioned request. <br>
ApplicationID and APIKey are stored in secure Hashicorp Vault (https://github.com/hashicorp/vault) service running inside DnA Platform. <br>
